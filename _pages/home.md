### About the Lab

The Inference and Retrieval Lab at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DIKU) is a team of faculty, postdocs, research scientists, programmers, and students 
who work together on models and algorithms that allow computers to process and make inferences about human language text.

Founded in 2012, our work is in the areas of information retrieval, data mining and applied machine learning (mainly for web data), 
with applications to search engines, recommender systems, plagiarism detection, opinion/sentiment mining, and text analytics, and with particular emphasis to large-scale web data.
