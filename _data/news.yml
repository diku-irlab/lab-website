    Researchers from the IR lab competed in the <a href=https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-sequential-skip-prediction-challenge>Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge</a> at WSDM Cup. 
    The task of the competition was to predict if users will skip or listen to the music they are currently streaming. 
    The team won the second place with a deep learning approach described in the following paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08408">Modelling Sequential Music Track Skips using a Multi-RNN Approach</a>.
